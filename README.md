#  Cupcake Corner

## Idea

- this project will look deeper into `Codable`
- there are four main topics in this project in which we will learn
    - custom `Codable` implementations
    - `URLSession`
    - `disabled()` modifier and more

## Introduction

- this project will be a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes
- we will make classes conform to `Codable` when they have `@Published` properties
- we will see how to send and receive the order data from the internet
- we will see how to validate forms, and more...
